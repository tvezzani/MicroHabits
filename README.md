# MicroHabits
A utility app for helping you build and maintain daily habits - for my senior project.

MicroHabits would be a web application that helps users track building better habits through small, repetitive daily actions. You would be able to set your own goals and track them, or work with your friends/family and keep each other accountable. The main problem with habit forming/habit breaking is the lack of accountability. This app helps to achieve accountability, whether used solo or with a partner or group.

Description
•	Why?
This app fulfills the need for people to track their personal habit goals. It could also help couples, or groups keep each other accountable when they make goals together, by tracking small, achievable actions and seeing progress. People attempting to keep track of their own habits will skew their actual progress because it’s hard to see the big picture. This app would help make your actual results and progress more visible, which would in turn encourage you to strengthen and solidify your habits.
•	What?
The web app would make use of a database and a login system, through google sign in API. Then, users can set a plan for a specific time duration. The users will enter their specified actions daily and get a report through email or notifications. At the end of the duration, they will be encouraged to adjust their plan based on performance. A score will be kept for the user based on their plan.
•	Who?
Examples of how this could work with people are as follows:
2 gym partners tracking food, exercise, and sleep. They would compete over 6 weeks to see who gets a better score.
A person wants to become a better reader. They make a goal to read 1 page a day for 3 weeks. After 3 weeks, they decide to up it to 2 pages. And so on…
A small company wants to expand their customer base, so they make a goal to make at least one cold contact per day for a week. The employee who scores the highest gets a bonus.
•	Where?
The data would be stored in a SQL database. The website would be located at microhabbits.com, which is currently an available domain. Of course, it would be totally free of charge. To pay for hosting, it could show google ads or accept donations in the future. Persons could use the app from anywhere with an internet connection, connecting people far apart and helping them build better habits.
•	How?
I will make use of W3Schools, my class reading resources, and the internet to research how to construct the website. I also have contacts who work in web development who I can contact for support.
•	When?
The project will be complete by the due date, when it functions as expected, allowing a user to register an account through Google API, create a plan, receive email reminders, and track their habits. They will be able to share their plan with others that they choose as well.
